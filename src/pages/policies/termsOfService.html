These Terms of Use and Conditions ("TOU" or "Agreement") govern your access to and use of the Software.

        <h2><i class="fas fa-shield-alt"></i> 5. Data Privacy and Security</h2>
        <p><strong>Hosting Over Internet:</strong> QNT42 is designed for being host over internet, but currently your data is still stored only on your end. Your data is stored on your device and is not transmitted externally unless explicitly configured by you. You are also responsible for the security of your device.</p>
        <p><strong>Backup:</strong> You are solely responsible for creating and maintaining backups of your encrypted data. We strongly recommend regular backups to prevent data loss.</p>
        <p><strong>Security Disclaimer:</strong> While QNT42 employs encryption and other security measures, no system is completely impenetrable. We do not guarantee the absolute security of your data and are not liable for any unauthorized access or data breaches not directly caused by our gross negligence or willful misconduct. You acknowledge and accept this risk.</p>

        <h2><i class="fas fa-copyright"></i> 6. Intellectual Property</h2>
        <p>The Software, including its design, code, and all related intellectual property rights, belongs to <a href="https://ed42.tech">ed42</a> and is protected by copyright laws. This Agreement grants you a limited license to use the Software, not a transfer of ownership. All rights not expressly granted to you are reserved by us.</p>

        <h2><i class="fas fa-exclamation-triangle"></i> 7. No Warranty</h2>
        <p>QNT42 is provided "as is" without any warranty of any kind, express or implied. We disclaim all warranties, including, but not limited to, warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, and title. We do not warrant that the Software will be error-free, uninterrupted, or secure. Any use of the Software is at your sole risk.</p>

        <h2><i class="fas fa-balance-scale"></i> 8. Limitation of Liability</h2>
        <p>To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, we are not liable for any damages (direct, indirect, incidental, consequential, special, or exemplary) arising from the use or inability to use QNT42, even if we have been advised of the possibility of such damages. Our total liability to you for any claim arising out of or in connection with this Agreement or the Software shall not exceed the amount you paid for the Software (if any). Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of certain damages, so this limitation may not apply to you.</p>

        <h2><i class="fas fa-gavel"></i> 9. Indemnification</h2>
        <p>You agree to indemnify and hold harmless QNT42, its affiliates, officers, directors, employees, and agents from any claims, damages, liabilities, and expenses (including reasonable attorney's fees) arising from your use of QNT42, your breach of these TOU, or your violation of any third-party rights.</p>

        <h2><i class="fas fa-globe"></i> 10. Governing Law and Dispute Resolution</h2>
        <p>This Agreement is governed by the laws of Morocco, without regard to its conflict of law principles. Any disputes arising under this Agreement shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of Morocco.</p>

        <h2><i class="fas fa-ban"></i> 11. Termination</h2>
        <p>We may suspend or terminate your access to the Software at any time, with or without cause, and with or without notice. Upon termination, you must cease all use of the Software and destroy all copies of the Software in your possession. Sections 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, and 13 shall survive termination.</p>

        <h2><i class="fas fa-file-contract"></i> 12. Entire Agreement</h2>
        <p>This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between you and us regarding the Software and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, whether written or oral.</p>

        <h2><i class="fas fa-cut"></i> 13. Severability</h2>
        <p>If any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions shall remain in full force and effect.</p>

        <h2><i class="fas fa-sync-alt"></i> 14. Changes to These Terms</h2>
        <p>We may update these TOU at any time. Continued use of the Software after updates constitutes acceptance of the revised TOU. It is your responsibility to review these TOU periodically for changes.</p>
