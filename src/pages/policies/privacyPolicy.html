            <p><strong>Important Note:</strong> This privacy policy describes our current data handling practices. We are committed to transparency and will update this policy as our application evolves.</p>
        </div>

        <h2><i class="fas fa-shield-alt"></i> 1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>Welcome to QNT42 ("we," "our," or "us"). We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring the security of your personal information. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you use our note-taking application.</p>
        <p>By using QNT42, you consent to the data practices described in this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree with the data practices described, you should not use our application.</p>

        <h2><i class="fas fa-info-circle"></i> 2. Information We Collect</h2>
        <h3>Current Implementation:</h3>
        <p>In the current version of QNT42:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Authentication Data:</strong> We use Firebase Authentication to manage user accounts. This service collects your email address and stores a securely hashed version of your password. We do not have access to your plain text password.</li>
            <li><strong>Note Content:</strong> All your notes are stored locally on your device using your browser's local storage. We do not store your notes on our servers.</li>
            <li><strong>Technical Information:</strong> We may collect anonymous usage statistics to help us improve the application.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Future Implementation:</h3>
        <p>In future versions, we plan to implement our own backend infrastructure. When this happens:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Your notes will be encrypted on your device before being transmitted to our servers</li>
            <li>We will implement end-to-end encryption so that only you can access your note content</li>
            <li>We will update this privacy policy to reflect these changes</li>
        </ul>

        <h2><i class="fas fa-lock"></i> 3. How We Use Your Information</h2>
        <p>We use the information we collect for the following purposes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>To create and authenticate your account</li>
            <li>To provide and maintain our service</li>
            <li>To notify you about changes to our service</li>
            <li>To provide customer support</li>
            <li>To gather analysis or valuable information so that we can improve our service</li>
            <li>To monitor the usage of our service</li>
            <li>To detect, prevent and address technical issues</li>
        </ul>

        <h2><i class="fas fa-database"></i> 4. Data Storage and Security</h2>
        <h3>Current Data Handling:</h3>
        <p><strong>Authentication Data:</strong> Your account information (email and hashed password) is stored by Firebase Authentication, which follows industry-standard security practices.</p>
        <p><strong>Note Data:</strong> Your notes are stored exclusively on your device in your browser's local storage. We do not have access to your notes.</p>
        
        <h3>Data Security:</h3>
        <p>We implement appropriate security measures to protect your information:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Firebase Authentication uses secure protocols for all data transmission</li>
            <li>We recommend that you use a strong, unique password for your account</li>
            <li>We do not store any note content on our servers in the current version</li>
        </ul>

        <h2><i class="fas fa-share-square"></i> 5. Information Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
        <p>We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer your personal information to third parties. We only share information in the following circumstances:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>With Firebase Authentication (Google) for account management purposes</li>
            <li>When required by law or to respond to legal process</li>
            <li>To protect the rights or property of our users, ourselves, or the public</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We want to emphasize that we do not use your data for advertising purposes and do not sell it to any third parties.</p>

        <h2><i class="fas fa-user-check"></i> 6. Your Data Rights</h2>
        <p>You have the following rights regarding your personal information:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Access:</strong> You can view your account information in your profile settings</li>
            <li><strong>Correction:</strong> You can update your account information at any time</li>
            <li><strong>Deletion:</strong> You can delete your account, which will remove your authentication data from Firebase</li>
            <li><strong>Export:</strong> You can export your notes from the application's export feature</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Since your notes are stored locally on your device, deleting your account will not automatically delete your notes. You should clear your browser's local storage if you wish to remove your notes.</p>

        <h2><i class="fas fa-sync-alt"></i> 7. Future Changes to Our Infrastructure</h2>
        <p>We are planning to develop our own backend infrastructure to replace Firebase Authentication. When we implement these changes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>We will migrate your account data to our secure servers</li>
            <li>We will implement end-to-end encryption for all note content</li>
            <li>We will ensure that we cannot access your unencrypted note content</li>
            <li>We will provide a detailed update to this privacy policy</li>
        </ul>

        <h2><i class="fas fa-sync-alt"></i> 8. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Effective Date" at the top.</p>
        <p>You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted on this page.</p>
